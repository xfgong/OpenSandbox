# Pre-start hook for opensandbox-supervisor wrapping the egress worker.
# Reaps any mitmdump left over from a previous crashed egress so the next
# launch can bind the transparent-MITM listen port (default 18081), and
# tears down stale iptables DNS redirect rules so DNS queries reach the
# real nameserver while the new egress process is still initializing.
#
# Scope:
#   * iptables NAT OUTPUT rules for port 53 ARE removed here. Without
#     this, a crashed egress leaves REDIRECT rules pointing at a dead
#     proxy (127.0.0.1:15353), causing DNS resolution failure for the
#     entire restart window. The new egress process re-installs them
#     after its DNS proxy is listening, so the unfiltered window is
#     limited to the startup duration (~200ms).
#   * The `inet opensandbox` nft table is NOT touched here. The
#     egress nftables manager already prepends `delete table inet
#     opensandbox` to its ruleset script, so ApplyStatic is idempotent.
#
# Hard contract: this script MUST NOT exit non-zero. A misbehaving cleanup
# hook is worse than a stray mitmdump; supervisor would treat the hook
# failure as a launch attempt and trip its crashloop budget faster.

# Intentionally no `set -e`. `set -u` for typo safety on env names only.

# traffic flows normally until the new egress re-installs them.
