 * Abstraction for storing pool coordination state and idle sandbox membership.

 * - Atomic take: one idle sandbox can only be taken by one acquire.
 * - Idempotent put/remove for idle membership.
 * - tryTakeIdle should prefer FIFO (oldest idle first) as best-effort.
 *
 * In distributed mode, only the current primary lock holder may execute
 * reconcile maintenance writes (putIdle, reapExpiredIdle). Foreground
 * acquire-path writes (tryTakeIdle, removeIdle) are allowed on all nodes.
